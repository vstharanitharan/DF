## 1. Central Claim

> **"Increasing the number of recurrent latent computation steps at inference time can improve reasoning accuracy without producing any additional natural-language reasoning tokens — but gains diminish and each extra step costs more compute/time."**

This is a falsifiable, empirical claim:
- **Testable positive aspect:** Model pathfinding accuracy and Path IoU increase monotonically as inference loop iterations $K$ increase from $K=1$ upward.
- **Testable negative aspect (trade-off):** Computation latency scales linearly with $K$, while accuracy gains saturate beyond a critical threshold ($K \ge 11$), demonstrating the boundary of diminishing returns.

---

## 2. Intended Audience & Prerequisites

- **Intended Audience**: Machine learning researchers, students, and practitioners studying test-time compute, reasoning models, non-autoregressive architectures, and post-transformer representations.
- **Prerequisites**: 
  1. Foundational understanding of neural network forward passes and hidden states.
  2. Intuition regarding spatial convolutions and receptive field expansion.
  3. Basic familiarity with discrete search algorithms (Breadth-First Search / BFS).

---

## 3. Explicit Learning Objectives

By interacting with this artifact, a learner will be able to:
1. **Contrast Latent Recurrence vs. Autoregressive Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**: Distinguish how fixed-tensor recurrent passes refine internal latent representations ($h_k = \text{Core}(h_{k-1}, x)$) without emitting variable-length text tokens into context memory.
2. **Explain Receptive Field Expansion via Weight-Shared Loops**: Understand how looping a shared $3 \times 3$ convolutional kernel $K$ times iteratively propagates spatial path connectivity without adding a single static parameter.
3. **Identify Empirical Diminishing Returns**: Trace the non-linear relationship where low-effort loops ($K=1 \to 5$) yield dramatic accuracy leaps ($+43.0\%$ exact solve rate), whereas high-effort loops ($K=11 \to 20$) produce marginal gains ($+4.0\%$) despite doubling computational cost.
4. **Contextualize Toy Results with Frontier Foundation Models**: Relate local spatial maze scaling dynamics to published results from Pathway's **BDH-CQ** architecture on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark (arXiv:2608.09888, Table 5).

---

## 4. The 60-Second Test

After exploring the artifact, a learner should be able to answer these questions:

* **Q1: Why does increasing $K$ from 1 to 5 drastically increase the maze solve rate, but increasing $K$ from 15 to 20 produces almost no gain?**  
  * **Answer:** Each recurrent loop expands the effective receptive field through the maze passages. Small $K$ values cannot bridge long corridor paths from start to goal. Once $K$ is large enough to span the critical path, the network has resolved topological connectivity; further iterations refine already-saturated probability logits, yielding diminishing returns while latency continues to grow linearly.

* **Q2: How does recurrent latent scaling differ from standard LLM Chain-of-Thought (CoT) at inference time?**  
  * **Answer:** CoT generates intermediate natural-language tokens appended to the context window, causing $O(N^2)$ attention memory growth, KV-cache pressure, and risks of semantic drift or syntactic errors. Latent recurrence performs fixed-shape tensor operations entirely within internal latent state ($h \in \mathbb{R}^{C \times H \times W}$), maintaining constant memory consumption with zero emitted verbal tokens.

* **Q3: What is Path IoU and why is it reported alongside Exact Solve Rate?**  
  * **Answer:** Exact Solve Rate is an all-or-nothing binary metric (0% or 100% per maze); stopping one step short of the goal yields a 0% score. Path IoU ($\frac{|\text{Predicted} \cap \text{GroundTruth}|}{|\text{Predicted} \cup \text{GroundTruth}|}$) measures continuous overlap, rewarding partial progress along the correct corridor and penalizing exploratory detours into dead ends or walls.

### Major UI Components & Roles:
- **Module 1: Interactive Reasoning Effort Slider & Maze Explorer**: Allows the learner to adjust reasoning effort $K \in [1, 20]$ or click "+ / − Effort". The "Auto" button steps $K$ upward automatically and halts as soon as the model reaches a fully connected path (typically $K=4–5$), letting the learner see the actual moment additional effort stops being necessary — visually reinforcing the plateau shown in the aggregate chart.
- **Module 2: Empirical Scaling Curve & Diminishing Returns Chart**: Dual-view SVG chart offering an aggregate 100-maze scaling curve (Exact Solve Rate % and Path IoU %) and an individual puzzle trace view with step-by-step progress tracking.
- **Module 3: Frontier Literature Integration (BDH-CQ ARC-AGI-1)**: Comparative benchmark cards displaying Table 5 results from arXiv:2608.09888.
- **Module 4: Technical Comparison & Concepts**: Side-by-side architectural comparison between autoregressive CoT and recurrent latent recurrence.

The following numbers are verified directly from `results/accuracy_by_effort.json` (evaluated on $N=100$ held-out $15 \times 15$ mazes, Seed 999, ConvGRU core, 123,713 parameters):

| Reasoning Loops ($K$) | Exact Solve Rate (%) | Mean Path IoU (%) | Mean BCE Loss | Measured Latency (ms / maze) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **$K = 1$ (Minimal)** | 1.0% | 55.94% | 0.3281 | 0.666 ms |
| **$K = 2$** | 2.0% | 65.53% | 0.2518 | 1.168 ms |
| **$K = 3$** | 19.0% | 76.63% | 0.1739 | 1.747 ms |
| **$K = 4$** | 35.0% | 83.29% | 0.1253 | 2.373 ms |
| **$K = 5$** | 44.0% | 87.69% | 0.0945 | 2.911 ms |
| **$K = 6$** | 53.0% | 90.93% | 0.0736 | 3.519 ms |
| **$K = 7$** | 63.0% | 93.12% | 0.0594 | 4.098 ms |
| **$K = 8$** | 71.0% | 94.75% | 0.0485 | 5.292 ms |
| **$K = 9$** | 74.0% | 95.64% | 0.0417 | 5.465 ms |
| **$K = 10$ (Inflection)** | **81.0%** | **96.61%** | **0.0364** | **6.155 ms** |
| **$K = 11$** | 84.0% | 97.12% | 0.0327 | 6.568 ms |
| **$K = 12$** | 84.0% | 97.42% | 0.0307 | 7.849 ms |
| **$K = 13$** | 85.0% | 97.51% | 0.0294 | 7.694 ms |
| **$K = 14$** | 87.0% | 97.83% | 0.0285 | 8.583 ms |
| **$K = 15$** | 88.0% | 98.01% | 0.0279 | 9.374 ms |
| **$K = 16$** | 86.0% | 98.12% | 0.0277 | 9.059 ms |
| **$K = 17$** | 86.0% | 98.11% | 0.0278 | 10.795 ms |
| **$K = 18$** | 87.0% | 98.14% | 0.0281 | 10.959 ms |
| **$K = 19$** | 88.0% | 98.20% | 0.0284 | 11.737 ms |
| **$K = 20$ (High)** | 88.0% | 98.13% | 0.0289 | 12.884 ms |

### Key Observations:
- **Steep Early Phase ($K=1 \to K=10$)**: Exact solve rate climbs from **1.0% to 81.0%** ($+80.0\%$ absolute gain) and Path IoU rises from **55.94% to 96.61%** as the recurrent loops expand the effective receptive field across the $15 \times 15$ maze.
- **Diminishing Returns Phase ($K=10 \to K=20$)**: Increasing $K$ from 10 to 20 yields only a **$+7.0\%$** gain in solve rate (81.0% $\to$ 88.0%), while inference latency more than doubles from **6.155 ms to 12.884 ms**.
- **Training Horizon & Generalization**: $K=16–20$ extends beyond the $K \sim \text{Uniform}(1, 15)$ training curriculum (`ml/train.py`). The model generalizes to these values because the recurrent core is weight-shared and has no explicit step-count parameter, but this was not part of the training distribution.

## 8. Frontier Literature Integration: BDH-CQ Comparison

In *"BDH-CQ: In-Context Learning with Recurrent Latent Reasoning"* (arXiv:2608.09888), Pathway evaluated recurrent latent reasoning effort on the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark:

| Effort Level | ARC-AGI-1 Pass@2 | Compute Cost Reduction | Relative Compute Cost |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **LOW** | 21.0% | -22.0% | 78% |
| **MEDIUM** | 27.0% | -11.0% | 89% |
| **HIGH** | 29.5% | Baseline (0.0%) | 100% |

*Evidence note: These numbers are external developer-reported results from Table 5 of Kosowski et al. (2026). They demonstrate the same core principle as our toy maze solver: allocating additional latent recurrent computation improves problem-solving capability up to an empirical plateau.*
